  "In your eyes, I see forever; A bond so strong, no force can sever; Through every trial, through joy and pain; Our love remains, a bright refrain; Your laughter lights my darkest days; A guiding star, a warming blaze; Each moment shared, a gift so rare;With you, my heart finds love laid bare; Forevermore, my soul will say; You are my light, my night, my day. ",
  "You’d never known the word love; Believing someday it’d come from up above; To only find that it was right in front of you; If only you had a clue; Thinking you lost your chance; That’d you'd never be able to give this girl a dance; Then you find out the fire between you could be true; The force you see could break a dam; That girl is you Sam.",
  "No treasure on Earth could match your worth; No diamond shines like your laughter; The way you love, the way you care; Has filled my life with treasures rare; Your touch, your words, all more valuable than gold; I belong with you; No gift could I give that equals your grace; You are my heart’s most loved space.",
  "The sun shines for 8 hours a day; But for me it shines 24/7; That’s because of this girl; Her presence can light up a room; Her smile can make you blind; Her laughter casts rays that can be seen from different galaxies; She is a star that never stops burning in my day. ",
  "Sometimes the darkness wins; It settles over me like a heavy fog; Dulling the edges of the world; Filling my mind with silence that feels too loud; I move through it slowly; Every step heavier than the last; Wondering if it will ever lift; Or if this is where I’m meant to stay; And then there’s you; You don’t banish the darkness; You don’t pretend it isn’t there; You just sit with me in it; Your presence a quiet reminder; That I’m not alone; You bring warmth where there was only cold; Not with bright flashes or grand gestures; But with the steady light of who you are; Because of you, I remember; The darkness is not endless; It is only a passing moment; In a life filled with your love.",
  "Loudness;Sometimes the world is too loud; and everyone else is talking; the quiet I crave is you; You listen to me without judgment,without interruption,as though my words matter; In a room full of voices,you hear me—not just the sound,but the weight behind it, the things I cannot say, I can’t get out; You hold my silence,and in that stillness,I find the space to be truly known; While others offer advice; you simply listen,and that is enough; Your presence alone gives me peace, reminds me that I am understood, even in my most difficult moments.",
  "When the world feels to heavy; And everything is unknown; Your presence is where I find peace; In your eyes, I see no judgment,only acceptance and calm; You are my sanctuary,the place where I can breathe,where I am simply enough.",
  "Every moment with you feels like a dream; Your love, a steady flowing stream; Together we've built something rare; A bond that shows how much we care; One year together, a milestone reached; My heart forever to yours is leached; Your smile still makes my heart race; In your arms is my favorite place; I promise to love you, day by day; As we continue on our beautiful way.",
  "A year of moments, big and small; Each one special, I treasure them all; The way you laugh, the way you smile; Makes every second with you worthwhile; From our first kiss to this day; You've shown me love in every way; I can't believe how lucky I've been; To have your heart and call you mine; Here's to our first year, my dear; And to many more, year after year.",
  "One year together, how time flies; When I'm with you, my spirit flies high; Through every season, winter to fall; Your love has been my all in all; The memories we've made are treasures; Filled with countless joyful pleasures; Your hand in mine feels just right; Like stars that brighten the darkest night; Thank you for twelve months of bliss; Sealed with every loving kiss.",
  "They say when you know, you know; And with you, my love continues to grow; A year has passed since we began; This journey together, hand in hand; Through laughter and tears, ups and downs; You're the one who turns my frowns; Into smiles that light up my face; With your warmth, your charm, your grace; Forever with you is where I belong; Our love a beautiful, endless song.",
  "Your eyes tell stories of kindness and grace; In this world, you're my favorite place; Through seasons changing, one thing stays true; My heart belongs completely to you; One year of memories we've written so far; Each one precious, like a wishing star; I promise to love you tomorrow and today; Walking beside you all the way; Happy anniversary to my heart's delight; You make my world incredibly bright."

// The original Christmas letter (keep this)
const letter = ` 
  Hey beautiful, aka Sam, aka my special girlfriend.
  Isn't this a surprise? Did you expect me to make an app for you? Did this pass your mind at all when you were guessing what I "got" for you. 
  You know, for a long time I was thinking of buying tickets to go to a drake concert together however they were either far away or really expensive and so I scrambled. At the start of December I had an aha moment. 
  I know how to code so why don't I do my best and do everything I can to make an app for my gorgeous girlfriend. She deserves the world so the least I could do is spend a few hours everyday from now until Christmas 
  to make an app for her and I hope you like it. I probably by this time already mentioned to you that I can update and change the app to whatever you want. I can add more comments or pictures or even more things on it 
  if you want. I am the one who controls it so anything you want done to it say the word and I'll make it happen and when a change happens like all updates I'll send you little patch notes on what changed. Now I just want 
  to say how lucky I am to have you as a girlfriend. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't think I emphasize that enough. I can truly be myself around you and feel free to let my childish behavior out. 
  I am the happiest and the most giddy when I am around you. I am so excited to spend this holiday season with you gorgeous, aka Sam, aka the most beautiful girl in the world. I can't wait to build that gingerbread house 
  together, wear our matching pajamas tonight, watch a Christmas movie and hopefully when it snows go sledding together. You truly make me the best version of me that I can be and I can't wait to spend many more holidays 
  with you my love.
  I love you so much Sam, more than words can ever describe. 
  From Chris & Willie❤️`;

// Add anniversary letter
const anniversaryLetter = `
 Dear Sam,

Can you believe it’s been a whole year since our love began?! 365 days, 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes, and 31,536,000 seconds of love, laughter, and growing together. The minute I saw you and talked to you for the first time, I knew you were special. In a weird way, when I was with you, I felt like I was home. I felt safe. I knew that there was something between us—some force that bound our souls together.

Talking to you came easy, laughing with you was easy, fucking with you was easy, and most of all, smiling with you was easy. I don’t think, in the 31,536,000 seconds of loving you, that I have ever faked a single smile when I’m with you. That’s just because you make it easy.

This was all before we even started on our destined journey of being in love with one another. I’m overwhelmed with gratitude that I have someone like you in my life—someone I can go to every day, talk to every day, or just be present with every single day. You don’t just get me—you understand me in a way I’ve never felt before. You understand my needs even when I’m silent.

I know you know this past year hasn't been the easiest with my mental health, but I need you to know how lucky and honored I feel that you listen and that you stand by my side for every challenge I face. You’ve seen me at my best and my worst, and somehow, you still choose to love both versions of me.

I’m going to go back to this point (don’t worry, the letter’s gonna become happy after this): you feel like home to me. If I have a bad day—go cuddle with Sam. If I have a bad high—go snuggle with Sam. If I’m scared, anxious, uneasy, disassociated, mad, sad, tired—GO SNUGGLE UP WITH SAM BECAUSE SHE IS A GODDAMN SAFE HAVEN.

You are my home. You are my safe haven. You are the greatest thing to ever step into my life, and I pray to God every day that I was lucky enough to find the love of someone as incredible as you—and I need you to know that. You are the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

Okay, now that I got that out… happy part, yay! I don't want this to be a long read, so I’ll keep it short, simple, and straight to the point. This past year—31,536,000 seconds—has been the most incredible journey and greatest year of my life.

In the beginning, I was so nervous. How could a guy like me be able to receive the love of someone as perfect and as beautiful as you? I wake up every day grateful that you chose me, and that we chose each other. I’m amazed at how far we’ve come in our relationship and how close we have gotten. It feels like I have known you for my entire life—it really does.

I love how we aren’t like other couples. I love how we are different in understanding each other and in how we act with each other. It’s like we are best friends, and I think it makes our relationship so diverse and so strong.

Baby, I love you. Your kindness, your strength, your humor, and your beauty (inside 😉 and out) continue to amaze me every single day. When you put your head on my shoulder or reach for my hand, my stomach still gets butterflies, and sometimes I’m still nervous to talk to you ‘cause I get frazzled by your gorgeousness.

As we start our second year together, I promise to continue growing with you, supporting your dreams, making you laugh until you snort (which is adorable, by the way), and showing you every day how much you mean to me.

Thank you for the best year of my life. Here's to many, many more.

All my love forever,
Chris
(& Willie, who sends purrs and a little saltiness that he’s no longer number one) ❤️
